# ZF2 Js Appender

This ZF2 Module aims to provide a fast way to configure Javascript libraries.

## Rationale

Often happens to have to set up a Javascript library and many times it would be nice to have a place where you can configure them
and perhaps with the ability to override the configuration rather than throw them in the view.
